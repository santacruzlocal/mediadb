## Laravel4 Migration Generator

### Generate migrations based on existing tables

Require this package in your composer.json:

    "barryvdh/laravel-migration-generator": "dev-master"

And update dependencies using composer:

    composer update

And add the ServiceProvider to the providers array in app/config/app.php

    'Barryvdh\MigrationGenerator\MigrationGeneratorServiceProvider',

You can now generate the migration by running the command, followed by the tables you want to generate

    php artisan migration-generate posts,users

Your migrations will be created in app/database/migrations

Migrations are generated by https://github.com/JeffreyWay/Laravel-4-Generators
This assumes the key is 'id' and timestamps (created_at/updated_at) are generated by default.
